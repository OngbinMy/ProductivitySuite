# Smart Contracts for Note-Taking, Task Management, and Time-Tracking

This repository contains three distinct smart contracts designed to manage notes, tasks, and time-tracking sessions on the blockchain. Each contract provides essential CRUD operations, user-specific data retrieval, and additional features like tagging and sharing.

## Contracts Overview

### 1. **Note-Taking Contract**
This contract allows users to create, update, share, and query notes.

### 3. **Time-Tracking Contract**
This contract tracks time spent on activities, allowing users to log, update, and query sessions.

#### Key Features:

- End a session by providing its ID.
- Update session details (description and tags).
- Retrieve sessions by ID or user.
- Tag filtering for sessions.

## Usage

Each contract is written in Clarity, a language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. To deploy and use these contracts:

1. Install the Stacks CLI.
2. Deploy the contract using the CLI or a compatible IDE.
3. Interact with the contract using methods provided in the respective smart contract files.

## Methods

Each contract provides public, read-only, and helper methods for interaction. Detailed documentation for each method can be found in the contract code.
